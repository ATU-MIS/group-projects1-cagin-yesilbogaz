**Project Name:** Health Coach Introduction  
**Tester:** Cagin Yesilbogaz (Student ID: 200202017)

## 1. Introduction
This usability test was conducted to assess the ease of use, design, and overall performance of the Health Coach website.

## 2. Participant Demographics
* **Total Users:** 8
* **Gender:** 3 Male, 5 Female
* **Age Range:** 20-65
* **Occupation:** Student, life coach, retired, civil servant.
* **Experience Level:** Daily website users.

## 3. Test Methodology
Users were given specific tasks and instructions on how to use the app. The moderator checked if the functions actually worked as intended. Participants consented to the recording of the test anonymously.

## 4. Tasks & Scenarios

### Task 1: Information Retrieval
**Goal:** Access necessary blog posts to understand whether heart palpitations are psychological or arrhythmia.
**Success Rate:** 100%
**Average Time:** 3 minutes

### Task 2: Expert Search
**Goal:** Finding experts (doctors/dietitians) who have achieved success in specific diseases.
**Success Rate:** 85%
**Average Time:** 12 minutes

### Task 3: Communication
**Goal:** Sending a message to contact doctors easily.
**Success Rate:** 90%
**Average Time:** 1 minute

## 5. Results & Observations

* **Overall Error Rate:** 15%
* **Positive Feedback:** Users generally liked the design and completed tasks quickly. They found the app functional and easy to use.
* **Negative Feedback:** Users expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of *real-time* health measurements (e.g., heart rhythm, blood pressure) directly on the website.

### Proposed Solution for Missing Features
Currently, weight and heart rhythm measurements are not available.
**Future Improvement:** Body mass index (BMI) calculators or heart rhythm analysis features can be developed using **Java** or **C#** backend services and integrated into the system.
